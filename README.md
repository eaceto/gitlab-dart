# GitLab API

This is a dart library to communicate with the [GitLab API v4](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/README.html). Forked from https://pub.dartlang.org/documentation/gitlab/latest/ in order to speed up the development process on new features.

## Installation

Simply add it to your project as a dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  gitlab: any
    git:
      url: https://github.com/eaceto/gitlab-dart.git
      ref: master

```
